                <p>When I started studying for the PMP, I wasted the first two weeks trying to figure out <em>what</em> to study. I jumped between YouTube videos, Reddit threads, and random PDFs without any real structure.</p>

                <p>That's time I'll never get back.</p>

                <p>This study plan is what I wish I had from day one. It's a complete 12-week roadmap designed for working professionals who can dedicate 15-20 hours per week to PMP preparation.</p>

                <p>By the end of this plan, you'll have covered all the material, completed 1,500+ practice questions, taken multiple full-length mock exams, and built the confidence to pass on your first attempt.</p>

                <div class="table-of-contents">
                    <h3>What's in This Plan</h3>

                <h2 id="before-you-start">Before You Start: Prerequisites</h2>

                <p>Before diving into week 1, make sure you have these in place:</p>

                <h3>1. Confirm Your Eligibility</h3>
                <p>PMI requires either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Four-year degree:</strong> 36 months leading projects + 35 hours PM education</li>
                    <li><strong>High school diploma:</strong> 60 months leading projects + 35 hours PM education</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Complete Your 35 Contact Hours</h3>
                <p>If you haven't done this yet, complete it before starting this plan. Options include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PMI's own courses</li>
                    <li>LinkedIn Learning PMP prep path</li>
                    <li>Udemy courses (Joseph Phillips, Andrew Ramdayal)</li>
                    <li>University/college PM courses</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Submit Your PMI Application</h3>
                <p>Do this in week 1 or before. The application can take 5-7 days for approval (longer if audited). You don't want application delays pushing back your exam date.</p>

                <h3>4. Set Your Exam Date</h3>
                <p>Schedule your exam for 12-13 weeks out. Having a firm date creates accountability. You can reschedule later if needed, but most people study more effectively with a deadline.</p>

                <h3>5. Gather Your Materials</h3>
                <p>At minimum, you need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access to practice questions (1,500+ recommended)</li>
                    <li>PMBOK Guide 7th Edition (free with PMI membership)</li>
                    <li>A way to track your progress</li>
                </ul>

                <hr style="margin: 40px 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #eee;">

                <h2 id="phase-1">Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build conceptual understanding of PM principles and frameworks. Don't memorize yet – focus on understanding <em>why</em> things work the way they do.</p>

                <p><strong>Time commitment:</strong> 15-18 hours/week</p>

                <h3>Week 1: Project Management Fundamentals</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is a project vs. operations?</li>
                    <li>Project life cycles (predictive, agile, hybrid)</li>
                    <li>Role of the project manager</li>
                    <li>Organizational structures and their impact on projects</li>
                    <li>Stakeholder identification basics</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Practice:</strong> 50-75 questions on fundamentals</p>
                
                <p><strong>End of week checkpoint:</strong> Can you explain the difference between predictive and adaptive approaches? Do you understand when each is appropriate?</p>

                <h3>Week 2: PMBOK 7 Principles</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 12 PM principles (understand each one deeply)</li>
                    <li>Value delivery system</li>
                    <li>Stewardship and ethics</li>
                    <li>Team and stakeholder engagement</li>
                    <li>Systems thinking</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Practice:</strong> 75-100 questions focused on principles</p>
                
                <p><strong>End of week checkpoint:</strong> Can you identify which principle applies to a given scenario? This is critical – PMI tests principles constantly.</p>

                <h3>Week 3: Performance Domains (Part 1)</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stakeholder Performance Domain</li>
                    <li>Team Performance Domain</li>
                    <li>Development Approach & Life Cycle Domain</li>
                    <li>Planning Performance Domain</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Practice:</strong> 100 questions across these domains</p>
                
                <p><strong>End of week checkpoint:</strong> Do you understand how these domains interconnect? Can you recognize which domain a question is testing?</p>

                <h3>Week 4: Performance Domains (Part 2)</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Project Work Performance Domain</li>
                    <li>Delivery Performance Domain</li>
                    <li>Measurement Performance Domain</li>
                    <li>Uncertainty Performance Domain</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Practice:</strong> 100 questions + take your first diagnostic mock exam (don't worry about the score – this is baseline measurement)</p>
                
                <p><strong>End of week checkpoint:</strong> Review your diagnostic exam. Which domains need the most work? This shapes your Phase 2 priorities.</p>

                </div>

                <h2 id="phase-2">Phase 2: Deep Practice (Weeks 5-8)</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Move from understanding to application. This phase is question-heavy – you should complete 800-1,000 practice questions during these four weeks.</p>

                <p><strong>Time commitment:</strong> 18-20 hours/week</p>

                <p><strong>Key principle:</strong> Review every question explanation, even ones you got right. Understanding <em>why</em> the right answer is right (and why wrong answers are wrong) is more valuable than just tracking your score.</p>

                <h3>Week 5: Predictive Approaches Deep Dive</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scope management (WBS, requirements, scope creep)</li>
                    <li>Schedule management (critical path, dependencies, float)</li>
                    <li>Cost management (budgeting, EVM basics)</li>
                    <li>Integration management (change control, project charter)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Practice:</strong> 200 questions focused on predictive/waterfall</p>
                
                <p><strong>Study tip:</strong> Create a one-page summary of EVM formulas (CV, SV, CPI, SPI, EAC, ETC, VAC). You'll need these for calculations.</p>

                <h3>Week 6: Agile & Hybrid Approaches</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Agile mindset and principles</li>
                    <li>Scrum framework (roles, events, artifacts)</li>
                    <li>Kanban basics</li>
                    <li>Hybrid approaches – when and how to combine</li>
                    <li>Servant leadership in agile</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Practice:</strong> 200 questions focused on agile/hybrid</p>
                
                <p><strong>Critical note:</strong> About 50% of the PMP exam covers agile and hybrid. Don't shortchange this week. Many candidates fail because they over-focus on predictive approaches.</p>

                <h3>Week 7: Risk, Quality, and Procurement</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk identification, analysis, and response planning</li>
                    <li>Qualitative vs. quantitative risk analysis</li>
                    <li>Quality management (plan, manage, control)</li>
                    <li>Procurement types (fixed price, T&M, cost-reimbursable)</li>
                    <li>Contract management</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Practice:</strong> 200 questions on risk, quality, procurement</p>
                
                <p><strong>Study tip:</strong> Create a risk response strategy chart (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept for threats; exploit, enhance, share, accept for opportunities).</p>

                <h3>Week 8: Communication, Resources, and Weak Areas</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communication management (channels formula, methods)</li>
                    <li>Resource management (team development, conflict resolution)</li>
                    <li>Stakeholder engagement strategies</li>
                    <li><strong>Your personal weak areas from Phase 1</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Practice:</strong> 200 questions + second full mock exam</p>
                
                <p><strong>End of week checkpoint:</strong> Compare mock exam 2 to your diagnostic. You should see improvement. If any domain is still below 60%, it needs intensive focus in Phase 3.</p>

                <h2 id="phase-3">Phase 3: Exam Simulation (Weeks 9-12)</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build exam stamina, fine-tune weak areas, and develop test-taking strategies. By the end of this phase, you should consistently score 70%+ on mock exams.</p>

                <p><strong>Time commitment:</strong> 15-20 hours/week</p>

                <h3>Week 9: Mock Exam + Intensive Review</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take a full 180-question mock exam under timed conditions</li>
                    <li>Spend 2-3 hours reviewing every missed question</li>
                    <li>Identify patterns in your mistakes (rushing? misreading? knowledge gaps?)</li>
                    <li>200 targeted practice questions on weak areas</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Exam simulation tip:</strong> Take the mock in one sitting, using both 10-minute breaks. Build the mental stamina for 3+ hours of focus.</p>

                <h3>Week 10: Mock Exam + Formula Review</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Another full mock exam (different questions if possible)</li>
                    <li>Master all formulas: EVM, communication channels, PERT, network diagrams</li>
                    <li>Review ITTOs at a high level (don't memorize – understand patterns)</li>
                    <li>150 practice questions</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Formula focus:</strong> You should be able to calculate EAC, ETC, VAC, SPI, CPI without hesitation. Practice until these are automatic.</p>

                <h3>Week 11: Final Mock Exam + Weak Area Blitz</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Final full mock exam – treat this like the real thing</li>
                    <li>If scoring 70%+, you're on track</li>
                    <li>If below 70%, focus exclusively on your two weakest domains</li>
                    <li>100-150 practice questions on weak areas only</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Mindset check:</strong> Some anxiety is normal. If you're consistently hitting 70%+ on mocks, you're ready. Trust your preparation.</p>

                <h3>Week 12: Light Review + Exam Day</h3>

                    <li>Review your summary sheets and formula cards</li>
                    <li>50-75 practice questions per day to stay sharp</li>
                    <li>Focus on rest, exercise, and stress management</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Day before exam:</strong></p>

                    <li>Trust your preparation</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="daily-schedule">Sample Daily Study Schedule</h2>

                <p>Here's how to structure your 2-3 hours of daily study time:</p>

                <h3>Option A: Morning Studier (before work)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>5:30-6:00am:</strong> Review flashcards or summary notes (warm-up)</li>
                    <li><strong>6:00-7:00am:</strong> Practice questions (25-30 questions with full review)</li>
                    <li><strong>7:00-7:30am:</strong> Read/study new material or weak areas</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Option B: Evening Studier (after work)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>7:00-7:30pm:</strong> Review notes from previous session</li>
                    <li><strong>7:30-8:30pm:</strong> New material or deep study</li>
                    <li><strong>8:30-9:30pm:</strong> Practice questions with review</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Option C: Split Schedule</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Morning (30 min):</strong> Flashcards and quick review</li>
                    <li><strong>Lunch (30 min):</strong> 10-15 practice questions</li>
                    <li><strong>Evening (1.5 hours):</strong> Deep study and practice</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Weekend bonus:</strong> Use weekends for longer sessions – mock exams, comprehensive review, and catching up if you fell behind during the week.</p>

                <h2 id="tracking">How to Track Your Progress</h2>

                <p>You can't improve what you don't measure. Track these metrics weekly:</p>

                <h3>Questions Completed</h3>
                <p>Target: 125-150 per week in Phase 1, 200-250 per week in Phases 2-3</p>

                <h3>Accuracy by Domain</h3>
                <p>Track your percentage correct for each performance domain. Any domain below 65% needs extra attention.</p>

                <h3>Mock Exam Scores</h3>
                <p>You should see progression:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diagnostic (Week 4): 55-65% is normal</li>
                    <li>Mock 2 (Week 8): 65-70% target</li>
                    <li>Mock 3 (Week 9): 68-73% target</li>
                    <li>Mock 4 (Week 10): 70-75% target</li>
                    <li>Final Mock (Week 11): 72%+ means you're ready</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Time Per Question</h3>
                <p>Target: 1 minute 15 seconds average. If you're consistently over 1:30, practice reading questions faster and making quicker decisions.</p>

                <h2 id="adjustments">When to Adjust the Plan</h2>

                <p>This plan isn't one-size-fits-all. Here's when to make adjustments:</p>

                <h3>Speed Up If...</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have significant PM experience (10+ years)</li>
                    <li>You're scoring 70%+ on early mock exams</li>
                    <li>You can dedicate 25+ hours per week</li>
                    <li>You've taken the PMP before</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Adjustment:</strong> Compress to 8-10 weeks by shortening Phase 1</p>

                <h3>Slow Down If...</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You're new to project management concepts</li>
                    <li>You're struggling to hit 60% on practice questions</li>
                    <li>You can only study 10-12 hours per week</li>
                    <li>English isn't your first language</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Adjustment:</strong> Extend to 14-16 weeks, spending more time in Phase 1</p>

                <h3>Pivot If...</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One domain is consistently below 55% after focused study</li>
                    <li>You're scoring lower on later mocks than earlier ones (burnout signal)</li>
                    <li>Life events disrupt your schedule for more than a week</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Adjustment:</strong> Take a short break, reschedule if needed, and rebuild momentum gradually</p>

                <h2>Your 12-Week Checklist</h2>

                </ul>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                <p>Three months is enough time to pass the PMP if you're consistent. The candidates who fail usually fall into one of two camps:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>They don't put in the hours.</strong> 15-20 hours per week isn't optional – it's the minimum for this timeline.</li>
                    <li><strong>They study passively.</strong> Watching videos and reading books feels productive, but practice questions with deep review is what actually prepares you for the exam.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>You now have a complete roadmap. The only thing left is execution.</p>

                <p>Set your exam date. Follow the plan. Trust the process.</p>

                <p>See you on the other side. 🎓</p>
